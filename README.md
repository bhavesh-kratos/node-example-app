- Right now in docker only node is present. As I am using mlab for mongo db. I will add docker configurations for mongodb too once done with other stuff.
- As of now, I am working on using other modules like pm2 and shipitjs in this project.
- To run docker:
```bash
 npm run start:docker
 ```
 Please note that docker is not working properly right now. Working on its config right now.
