- Setup
```bash
 npm install
 ```
- To run in dev:
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 ```
- Don't use start:docker for now as I am still working on docker integration.
- Right now in docker only node is present. As I am using mlab for mongo db. I will add docker configurations for mongodb too once done with other stuff.
- As of now, I am working on using other modules like pm2 and shipitjs in this project.
